# PrivacyTrader-Terminal
Lightweight, privacy-focused desktop application designed for professional traders who need real-time orderbook data and rapid trade execution capabilities.

Built with Python and PyQt5, it connects directly to Interactive Brokers' API to provide Level II market data for stocks and futures across multiple exchanges. <br>
<br>
Unlike cloud-based alternatives, PrivacyTrader stores all data locally with AES-256 encryption, has zero telemetry, and operates with minimal network footprint. <br>
<br>
The application complements TradingView for charting while focusing exclusively on orderbook visualization and trade execution. With its clean, minimal interface, traders can quickly place market, limit, and stop orders while monitoring positions and P&L in real-time.
PrivacyTrader is ideal for day traders, scalpers, and privacy-conscious investors who prioritize data security and execution speed over complex features. <br>
